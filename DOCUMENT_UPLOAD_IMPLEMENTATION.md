# Document Upload and Parsing System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive document upload and parsing system for the AskRita app with full support for PDF, Word (.doc, .docx), and Excel (.xls, .xlsx, .csv) files. The system includes text extraction, organization-based isolation, and enhanced UI/UX features.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Supabase Edge Function (`extract-document-text`)
- **Location**: `/supabase/functions/extract-document-text/index.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Extracts text from PDF, Word, and Excel documents
  - Supports .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .csv, and .txt files
  - Stores extracted content in the `document_content` table
  - Updates processing status in real-time
  - Maintains organization isolation

### 2. Enhanced File Upload Component
- **Location**: `/src/components/documents/FileUploadZone.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Drag-and-drop interface
  - File type and size validation (10MB max)
  - Real-time upload progress tracking
  - Processing status indicators
  - Support for batch file uploads
  - Visual file type icons

### 3. Document Preview Component
- **Location**: `/src/components/documents/DocumentPreview.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Full-text preview of extracted content
  - Metadata display (word count, character count)
  - Copy to clipboard functionality
  - Export as text file
  - Admin-only delete option
  - Processing status badges

### 4. Enhanced Documents Page
- **Location**: `/src/pages/Documents.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Improved file listing with status badges
  - Visual file type indicators
  - Click-to-preview functionality
  - File size display with proper formatting
  - Processing status tracking (pending, processing, completed, failed)

## Security Implementation

### Storage Bucket Policies
- **File**: `storage-bucket-setup.sql`
- Organization-based isolation for file storage
- RLS policies for CRUD operations
- File type and size validation at database level
- Admin-specific delete permissions

### Supported File Types
- **PDF**: .pdf (application/pdf)
- **Word**: .doc, .docx (application/msword, application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document)
- **Excel**: .xls, .xlsx (application/vnd.ms-excel, application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet)
- **CSV**: .csv (text/csv)
- **Text**: .txt (text/plain)

## Database Schema
The implementation uses existing tables:
- `document_folders`: Organizes documents by category
- `document_files`: Stores file metadata and processing status
- `document_content`: Stores extracted text content with organization_id

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Edge Function**:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy extract-document-text
   ```

2. **Apply Storage Policies**:
   - Run `storage-bucket-setup.sql` in Supabase SQL editor

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set for advanced text processing (optional)

## Usage Flow

1. **Upload Files**: Users drag and drop or select files to upload
2. **Validation**: System validates file type and size (10MB limit)
3. **Storage**: Files are stored in Supabase storage with organization isolation
4. **Processing**: Edge function extracts text content asynchronously
5. **Preview**: Users can view extracted content and metadata
6. **Management**: Admins can delete documents

## Processing Status States
- **Pending**: File uploaded, waiting for processing
- **Processing**: Text extraction in progress
- **Completed**: Content successfully extracted
- **Failed**: Extraction failed (unsupported format or error)

## Future Enhancements
- OCR support for scanned PDFs
- Advanced text analysis with OpenAI
- Bulk download functionality
- Search within documents
- Document versioning

## Testing
The system has been tested with:
- Various file formats (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, TXT)
- Multiple file uploads
- Large files up to 10MB
- Organization isolation
- Admin vs user permissions
