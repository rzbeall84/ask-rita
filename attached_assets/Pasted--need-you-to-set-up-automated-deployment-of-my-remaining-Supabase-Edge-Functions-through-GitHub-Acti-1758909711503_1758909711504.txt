 need you to set up automated deployment of my remaining Supabase Edge Functions through GitHub Actions. Here’s what I need:

Current Status:

	•	I have 28 edge functions total that need to be deployed to Supabase
	•	I’ve already manually deployed 11 functions through the Supabase dashboard:
	1.	`create-admin-user` (deployed an hour ago)
	2.	`smooth-function` (deployed an hour ago)
	3.	`quick-service` (deployed an hour ago)
	4.	`rapid-handler` (deployed 38 minutes ago, 2 deployments)
	5.	`clever-endpoint` (deployed an hour ago)
	6.	`smooth-api` (deployed an hour ago)
	7.	`clever-worker` (deployed an hour ago)
	8.	`smooth-service` (deployed 40 minutes ago)
	9.	`bright-api` (deployed 39 minutes ago)
	10.	`swift-endpoint` (deployed 39 minutes ago)
	11.	`bright-handler` (deployed 38 minutes ago)

Problem: These functions have auto-generated names instead of my intended function names from the original deployment list.

What I Need You To Do:

	1.	Audit my current deployment by checking which of my 28 intended functions are actually deployed (the content matters, not the names)
	2.	Create a GitHub Actions workflow that will:
	◦	Deploy the remaining 17 functions with their CORRECT names
	◦	Optionally redeploy the 11 existing functions with proper names if needed
	◦	Handle the deployment order from my original instructions (security functions first, then AI functions, etc.)
	3.	Set up the workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy-supabase.yml`) with:
	◦	Proper Supabase CLI setup
	◦	Environment variables for my project
	◦	Error handling for failed deployments
	◦	Deployment order based on dependencies
	4.	Create deployment scripts that:
	◦	Map my 28 intended functions to what’s already deployed
	◦	Deploy only the missing functions with correct names
	◦	Provide clear logging of what’s being deployed
	5.	Generate the secrets configuration I need to add to GitHub

My Supabase Project Details:

	•	Project ID: `onargmygfwynbbrytkpy`
	•	I have all 28 function files ready in the `supabase/functions/` directory
	•	Functions need specific JWT settings (some require JWT, others don’t)

Expected Outcome:
After this setup, I should be able to push code to GitHub and have all remaining edge functions automatically deploy to Supabase with their correct names, without any manual browser clicking.

Please start by checking which of my 28 intended functions are actually deployed (regardless of their current names) and then create the complete automation solution for the remaining ones.
